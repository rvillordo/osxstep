# osxstep - 0.3

 source for osxstep library, work in progress...

## Overview

 OSXStep is a small toolkit for OSX. it allows you to create cocoa visual interfaces in C 
 without the need of using Carbon. It was based on libxstep
 
 The status of this code is 'work in progress'. I had created this library for personal 
 usage, and the code won't be going to be updated that often.
